# Tracer's Perpetual Pools Subgraph
Subgraph for Tracer's Perpetual Pools. This subgraph is unlikely to be integrated into the [pools interface](https://pools.tracer.finance) as we have a different pipeline for streaming and recording txn historics. However, the Subgraph protocol serves an important purpose in community development.

This Subgraph is likely to change. If you would like to see any additions just reach out through [discord](https://discord.gg/vrG3cAXv) or via a PR.

If you are interested in browsing the schema I find using the [Subgraph Playground](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/tracer-protocol/tracer-pools-arbitrum) the most effective.
